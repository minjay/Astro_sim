% Input variables:
%
% st_x: the starting value of x
% en_x: the end value of x
% st_y: the starting value of y
% en_y: the end value of y
% step_x: the step size of x
% step_y: the step size of y
% set_size: the size of each seed set. It cannot be too large otherwise
% the seed set would spread out too much.
% cell_log_intensity: the log intensity of voronoi cells
% cell_area: the area of voronoi cells
% cx: the x coordinate of points
% cy: the y coordinate of points
% factor: the factor alpha that determines the width of the interval
% k: number of nearest neighbors to determine local maxima
% set_size2: the size of each seed set found by local maxima
% invalid: the set of points that are invalid
% adj_mat: the adjacent matrix. 1 means connected, 0 means not.

% Output variables:
%
% seeds: seed sets selected uniformly (excluding those rejected)
% seeds_rej: seed sets which are rejected
% seeds_pt: seed sets found by local maximum
% num_s: the number of seed sets selected uniformly (excluding those rejected)
